                                    To scan your DiceKey into the DiceKeys app for MacOS or Android, load in your DiceKey, choose the "SoloKey" option on the bottom tab (look for the picture of a SoloKey), insert your SoloKey, and follow the instructions from there.

                                    If you only have a Windows PC, we have provided a <a href="https://github.com/dicekeys/seeding-from-windows">command-line tool</a> for seeding your SoloKey.  We'll soon update our web-based app to provide the seed so that you can copy it to the command line.
                                    After that, we'll start working on a full windows app.

                                    We cannot offer seeding on iPhones or iPads as Apple prohibits iOS apps from accessing any USB device directly.
                                    We cannot offer seeding via the web app, as browsers are current blocking communications with security keys specifically.

                                    We disclosed this limitation in an update to backers while orders could still be cancelled, but are sorry that we e were not aware of these limitations during the campaign.
                                    The limitations on USB devices on iOS are not clearly documented by Apple.
                                    The Chrome team only only documented that they block communications with security keys<i>after</i> we filed a bug with them.

                                    For now, you can scan your DiceKey into the DiceKeys app and use the app to generate the 'master' password for your password manager. You can copy and paste it into your password manager. We also offer an API that allows password manager apps to request your master password from the DiceKeys app, or even request a cryptographic key that will make your master password entirely unnecessary.

                                    The die in the top left corner when you scan your DiceKey once may be in a different corner the next time you scan it. No problem! The DiceKeys app orients your DiceKey before generating passwords and keys so that it doesn't matter which corner is the top left. (This is why the security strength is 196 bits, not 198 bits.)

When you purchase a DiceKey, you pay an up-front cost with no hidden subscriptions or up-sells. While other businesses are built around turning customers into recurring revenue streams, we've invested in designing a product that's meant to last your lifetime. The hardware is 100% yours and the software is open source to ensure your rights to use it never expire.

                                    We are taking an authentication product to market at a time when the five largest US companies by market capitalization all play the role of identity providers, and even the "smaller" companies focused solely on authentication products are raising tens to hundreds of millions of dollars (each!) from venture capitalists. Patenting prevents free-loaders from draining the revenue stream that will continue to fund the open-source software DiceKeys rely upon. Patenting gives us a fighting chance to see a return on our significant investment of time and money. Patenting also empowers us to require that licensees meet standards for product quality, labor, and environmental impact -- preventing a race to the bottom in which the winning strategy is to abandon all such concerns.

                                    Imagine a game of musical chairs with 26 uppercase letters but only 25 dice for them to sit on. 
                                    Now imagine one of those letters has a vestigial tail, which makes it harder to sit. 
                                    That tail of a Q extends below the font's baseline. 
                                    To accommodate the Q, every die would need to use a smaller font, making all letters and digits harder to read.

                                    Stickeys are a way to backup DiceKeys. Each kit comes with 150 stickers (one for each die face). 
                                    You backup your DiceKey by building a 5x5 grid of stickers that matches your DiceKey.

                                    We are planning to in the future. We will likely use two-sided metal chips (similar to Stickeys) to achieve a relatively flat form factor.

                                    We have produced lids that don't lock. We're still finding a way to distribute them since Crowd Supply was unable to offer them.

                                    We don't recommend creating replacement parts with a 3D printer.
                                    In our prototyping, filament-based printers lacked sufficient precision.
                                    SLA printers were precise enough to create reasonable replicas that can hold dice, but the latches to hold the pieces together were not reliably flexible enough during assembly or strong enough after.
                                    We can share latch-less reference designs for experimentation or personal use by those who recognize these limitations and concerns.
                                    We have relied upon the expertise of our injection-mold manufacturer to customize the latches to their materials and manufacturing process, and their customizations are not ours to share.

                                    You could, but that could be risky your printer is not properly secured or the network you use to connect to it is vulnerable. 
                                    Stickeys allow you to replicate your DiceKey without relying on a printer to be secure.
