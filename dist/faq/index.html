										for the exclusive purpose of protecting the right to produce DiceKeys hardware (including Stickeys).
										When you purchase a DiceKey, you pay an up-front cost with no hidden subscriptions or up-sells. 
										While other businesses are built around turning customers into recurring revenue streams, 
										we've invested in designing a product that's meant to last your lifetime. 
										The hardware is 100% yours and the software is open source to ensure your rights to use it never expire.
										<br />
										We are taking an authentication product to market at a time when the five largest US companies by market capitalization all play the role of identity providers, 
										and even the "smaller" companies focused solely on authentication products are raising tens to hundreds of millions of dollars (each!) from venture capitalists. 
										Patenting prevents free-loaders from draining the revenue stream that will continue to fund the open-source software DiceKeys rely upon. 
										Patenting gives us a fighting chance to see a return on our significant investment of time and money. 
										Patenting also empowers us to require that licensees meet standards for product quality, labor, and environmental impact --
										preventing a race to the bottom in which the winning strategy is to abandon all such concerns.
