                            For now, you can scan your DiceKey into the DiceKeys app and use the app to generate the
                            'master' password for your password manager. You can copy and paste it into your password
                            manager.
                            We also offer an API that allows password manager apps to request your master password from
                            the
                            DiceKeys app, or even request a cryptographic key that will make your master password
                            entirely
                            unnecessary.

                        <div class="answers__item-answer">
                            You scan your DiceKey into the DiceKeys app, choose the "Seed SoloKey" option, and follow
                            the instructions. (This currently only works on the Android and MacOS apps as iOS apps are
                            not permitted to write to USB devices.)

                        <div class="answers__item-answer">The letter and digit on each die are also encoded a second
                            time into the binary code in the underline, and a third time into the overline. The DiceKeys
                            app checks the letter and digit once against the encoding in the underline and again using

                            website. That's because we don't collect any data. We don't have a server for our app to
                            contact because its designed to run entirely without access to a network.
                            We also won't ask you to rate our app. We're not selling apps.

                        <div class="answers__item-answer">Stickeys are a way to backup DiceKeys. Each kit comes with 150
                            stickers (one for each die face). You backup your DiceKey by building a 5x5 grid of stickers
                            that matches your DiceKey.</div>

                        <div class="answers__item-answer">We are planning to in the future. We will likely use two-sided
                            metal chips (similar to Stickeys) to achieve a relatively flat form factor.</div>

                        <div class="answers__item-answer">Not easily, and you might break it if you try. In our design,
                            we prioritized making it hard for the dice to accidentally come out of arrangement over
                            making it easy to re-arrange them.</div>

                        <div class="answers__item-answer">The die in the top left corner when you scan your DiceKey once
                            may be in a different corner the next time you scan it. No problem! The DiceKeys app orients
                            your DiceKey before generating passwords and keys so that it doesn't matter which corner is
                            the top left. (This is why the security strength is 196 bits, not 198 bits.)</div>

                        <div class="answers__item-answer">You could, but that could be risky your printer is not
                            properly secured or the network you use to connect to it is vulnerable. Stickeys allow you
                            to replicate your DiceKey without relying on a printer to be secure.</div>

                        <div class="answers__item-question">What open-source license do you use?</div>
                        <div class="answers__item-answer">Our software is available under the MIT license. It allows us
                            to license the software without licensing the DiceKeys software without the patents needed
                            to produce DiceKeys hardware.</div>

                        <div class="answers__item-question">Is the DiceKeys hardware patented?</div>
                        <div class="answers__item-answer">Yes. We have filed a patent (pending) for the exclusive
                            purpose of protecting the right to produce DiceKeys hardware (including Stickeys).
                            When you purchase a DiceKey, you pay an up-front cost with no hidden subscriptions or
                            up-sells. While other businesses are built around turning customers into recurring revenue
                            streams, we've invested in designing a product that's meant to last your lifetime. The
                            hardware is 100% yours and the software is open source to ensure your rights to use it never
                            expire.
                            We are taking an authentication product to market at a time when the five largest US
                            companies by market capitalization all play the role of identity providers, and even the
                            "smaller" companies focused solely on authentication products are raising tens to hundreds
                            of millions of dollars (each!) from venture capitalists.
                            Patenting prevents free-loaders from draining the revenue stream that will continue to fund
                            the open-source software DiceKeys rely upon. Patenting gives us a fighting chance to see a
                            return on our significant investment of time and money. Patenting also empowers us to
                            require that licensees meet standards for product quality, labor, and environmental impact
                            -- preventing a race to the bottom in which the winning strategy is to abandon all such
                            concerns.

                            That tail of a Q extends below the font's baseline. To accommodate the Q, every die would
                            need to use a smaller font, making all letters and digits harder to read.
